## Part 3 - Enhancements:
I implemented the search bar functionality on my projects page so that as users type, a dropdown menu appears with matching results, highlighting relevant text. Clicking an option takes the user directly to the corresponding project detail page (the same page they’d see if they clicked "Read More" on a project card). On the project detail page, users can view full project details, including technologies used, responsibilities, and descriptions. There’s also a button to navigate back to the projects page, along with a night mode option. The search bar improves navigation by allowing users to quickly find projects using keywords related to technologies, responsibilities, or project titles. Since the project cards only display a preview while full details are available on the project detail page, this feature saves users from manually checking each project. It immediately indicates if a project matches their search and provides a quick way to navigate to it. I updated the Spotify link on my home page to direct users to a page with links to my latest single across multiple streaming services (instead of just the Spotify link), making it more accessible for those using platforms other than Spotify. Beneath this, I embedded a Spotify widget that lets users preview my song or play the full version if logged into Spotify. To ensure consistency, I made further CSS updates to maintain proper resizing across different screen sizes and integrated night mode handling for all new changes. A favicon was also implemented across all HTML pages to enhance branding and provide a more professional appearance in the browser. The favicon is included in multiple sizes for accessibility and compatibility across various browsers.
