## Part 3 - Enhancements:
I implemented the search bar functionality on my projects page so that as users type, a dropdown menu appears with matching results, highlighting relevant text. Clicking an option takes the user directly to the corresponding project detail page (the same page they’d see if they clicked "Read More" on a project card). On the project detail page, users can view full project details, including technologies used, responsibilities, and descriptions. There’s also a button to navigate back to the projects page, along with a night mode option. I implemented the search bar to make it easier and faster for users to find projects with keywords relating to things like technologies, responsibilities, project titles etc. Since the project cards only show a preview while the full details are available on the project detail page, the search bar saves users from having to manually check each project. It lets them know right away if a project matches their search and allows them to navigate there quickly. I also changed the Spotify link to my single on my home page to a link to a page that provides the links to my latest single on many different streaming services, not just Spotify, to make it more accessible for users with other streaming services. Underneath this link, I also added a Spotify widget that allows users to preview my song or play the whole thing if logged into Spotify. I ensured that each change I made to my site was met with proper night mode handling. I also made more updates in the CSS to ensure that everything continues to resize nicely on different screen sizes.
