## Part 3 - Enhancements:
I implemented the functionality of my search bar on my projects page so that a dropdown menu will appear with highlighted text options that match the input. If an option is clicked, it will take you to its project detail page (this is what will come up if you press "Read More" on any of my project cards). Once on a project's detail page, users can see full details about the project. There is a button to navigate back to the projects page as well as a night mode option there as well. I implemented the search bar functionality to provide an efficient way for users to search anything from technologies used, responsibilities, project titles, etc., so that they can quickly find projects relevant to what they are looking for. Since most project details are hidden on the project card preview (you see a preview but to read full details, technologies, and responsibilities you need to go to the project detail page) until pressing "Read More", this search bar lets users know if any of the projects contain matching details so they don't have to go digging themselves. I also changed the Spotify link to my single on my home page to a link to a page that provides the links to my latest single on many different streaming services, not just Spotify, to make it more accessible for users with other streaming services. Underneath this link, I also added a Spotify widget that allows users to preview my song or play the whole thing if logged into Spotify. I ensured that each change I made to my site was met with proper night mode handling.
